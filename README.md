# Smart Blinds System

In the era of the Internet of Things, even the simplest pieces of furniture or house accessories can be automated, resulting in more impressive outcomes than we might imagine. Smart blinds and window systems are not a new idea, and companies have started developing such products, emphasizing the following benefits:

- **Natural Alarm:** Schedule bedroom shades to open in the morning for a natural, sunny wake-up call.
- **Morning Routine:** Schedule kitchen shades to open while you’re enjoying breakfast.
- **Evening Privacy:** Schedule all shades throughout your house to close in the evening.
- **Enhanced Security:** Enhance security by scheduling shades to move at set times, giving your home a lived-in look while you’re away.
- **Temperature Control:** In summer or warmer climates, schedule shades to close during the day to keep your house cooler.

These features are quite appealing and practical. However, the sun's position and intensity change throughout the day, and these variations also depend on the seasons and weather conditions. To address this, we propose using a photovoltaic panel to measure the environmental light intensity. By continuously adjusting the position of the blinds with a servo motor actuator, we can maintain a constant brightness level set by the user.

This approach ensures that the lighting conditions in your home are always optimal, adapting in real-time to changes in sunlight and weather, providing both convenience and energy efficiency.
